/**
The Gyroscope class reports rotational data from the Phidget containing a gyroscope chip for use in your code. Phidget gyroscopes usually have multiple sensors, each oriented in a different axis, so multiple dimensions of heading can be recorded.

If the Phidget you're using also has an accelerometer and a magnetometer, you may want to use the Spatial classin order to get all of the data at the same time, in a single event.
