/**
The Voltage Ratio Input class is used for measuring the ratio between the voltage supplied to and the voltage returned from an attached sensor or device. This is useful for interfacing with ratiometric sensors or wheatstone bridge based sensors.

For ratiometric sensors, this class supports conversion to sensor data with units specific to the Phidget sensor being used, to make reading these sensors easy.
