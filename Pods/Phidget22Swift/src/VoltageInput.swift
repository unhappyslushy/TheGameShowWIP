/**
The Voltage Input class measures the voltage across the input of a Phidget with a voltage input. This may be a sensor designed to measure voltage directly, or it could be an input designed to interface with 0-5V sensors.

For 0-5V sensors, this class supports conversion to sensor data with units specific to the Phidget sensor being used, to make reading these sensors easy.
