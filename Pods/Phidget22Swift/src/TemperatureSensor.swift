/**
The Temperature Sensor class gathers data from the temperature sensor on a Phidget board. This includes on-board ambient temperature sensors, connected thermocouples or platinum RTDs, and IR temperature sensors. This class is also used to measure the temperature on some high-power Phidget boards such as motor controllers for safety reasons.

If you're using a simple 0-5V sensor that does not have its own firmware, use the VoltageInput or VoltageRatioInput class instead, as specified for your device.
