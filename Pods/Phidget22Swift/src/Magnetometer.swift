/**
The Magnetometer class gathers magnetic compass data from Phidget boards. Phidget magnetometers usually have multiple sensors, each oriented in a different axis, so multiple dimensions of compass bearing can be recorded.

If the Phidget you're using also has a gyroscope and an accelerometer, you may want to use the Spatial class in order to get all of the data at the same time, in a single event.
