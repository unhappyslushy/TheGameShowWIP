/**
The Accelerometer class is used to gather acceleration data from Phidget accelerometer boards. Phidget accelerometers usually have multiple sensors, each oriented in a different axis, so multiple dimensions of acceleration can be recorded.

If the Phidget you're using also has a gyroscope and a magnetometer, you may want to use the Spatial class in order to get all of the data at the same time, in a single event.
